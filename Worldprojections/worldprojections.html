    <h1>Homework 2- Geography 370</h1>
    <h1>Douglas Hill</h1>

    <h1>In this project I learned how to display images in different projections</h1>
    
    <h2 style="color:red">I was able to change the projections by clicking on the lower right corner of the QGIS page and open a filter selector.  In it I was able to search a large database of different projections.  Using the filter search bar and some idea of what I wanted to project, I was able to select and apply the projection to my map.  Each map was slightly different in the stretch and pull of the map.</p>
    
    <h2>Pseudo Mercator</h2>
    <h3>The Pseudo Mercator is from a cylinderical view of the planet.  The polar regions of the planet are stretched to relect that view.</h3>

    <h2>Winkel Tripel</h2>
    <h3>Accounts for some of the curvature but also blends in the mercator style maps</h3>

    <h2>World From Space</h2>
    <h3>INteresting perspective of the globe and areas are closest to even of the maps I examined.</h3>

    </a>
    <h2>World Mercator</h2>
    <h3>Compressed map and stretched. South Pole seems to have an axtremely large land mass in relation to the rest of the planet.  </h3>

    <h2>World Sinusoidal ESRI 54008</h2>
    <h3>I thought this was interesting because I can think of no good reason for this type of map projection.  Very odd.</h3>

    <h2>World Cylindrical Equal Area</h2>
    <h3>Land massses at the equator seem to me much larger than areas north or south of it.</h3>
    <a href=".//maps/ESRI 54034 Cylinder.png">
    <img src=".//maps/ESRI 54034 Cylinder.png" alt="ESRI 54034" width='500px'>

    <h2>World Equidistant Conical</h2>
    <h3>Top down view as if a cone was flattened.  The earth seems normal close to the central axis and distorted as you move away from it.</h3>
    <a href=".//maps/World Equidistant Conical.png">

    <h2>North Pole Azimuthal</h2>
    <h3>Very similar to the World Equidistant Conical projection. Difficult to determine any differences at first glance</h3>
    <a href=".//maps/North Pole Azimuthal ESRI 102016.png">

    <h2 style="color:red">Now, you should <u>add the following projections on your own:</u></h2>
    <h3>EPSG: 3857, 53018, 54034, 54027, 102016, and two additional projections that you choose.</h3>
